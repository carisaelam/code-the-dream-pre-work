# üñºÔ∏è Search Art Project

Welcome to <strong>Search Art!</strong> This site allows users to explore artwork using data from the Art Institute of Chicago's public API. Users can search for art by keyword and adjust the number of results. The search functionality is powered by <em>Elasticsearch</em>, which ranks results by relevance based on the search term. If the search fails or returns no results, an alert prompts the user to try a different search.

The home page features a gallery of artwork displayed in card-like elements with images, titles, and artists. Clicking on a card takes the user to a detailed display page where more information about the piece is shown. This display view uses the image ID passed via URL parameters to query additional data from the API such as the description of the image and some data about the color of the image. The color data is used to dynamically create a matching background that complements the piece of art.
